# Linear Regression 
Consider you run a E-commerce Store that sells clothing online but you also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

I have created a linear regression model using scikit-learn that helps to predict whether you should focus more on your website or on mobile app generation of revenue.

** Note : It is a fake customer data used for predcition analysis. However if you have real datasets, you may go ahead to use it.
